Even more useless example


I promised you something :)

We try to force our black hole to emit something.

echo 'whatever' > /dev/null

cat /dev/null

Hm, no. It doesn't work.

Ok, let's try differently

echo 'whatever' > tmpfile && mv tmpfile /dev/null

cat /dev/null

WOW! Our black hole emits whatever radiation!

But.. is it?

No, it is not.

If we run

file /dev/null

We will see /dev/null: ASCII text It means, we have simple text file, not special one!

Let's see different view

ls -al /dev/null

The output will be -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9 May 11 21:07 /dev/null

It is definitely not what we wanted to see.

This thing might happen. IT SHOULDN'T but it might. So, how to recover the proper /dev/null?
First, we need to remove faulty file

rm /dev/null

Don't worry, nothing bad happen. It already happened :)

And now we have to run

mknod -m 0666 /dev/null c 1 3

mknod creates a speacial file
-m 0666 says about file permission
/dev/null is the name
c is the device type
1 3 are the MAJOR and MINOR numbers to specify the device
I want to focus your attention on device type. We used c. When we run

ls -al /dev/null

We will see

crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 May 2 10:20 /dev/null

Did you noticed c on the beginning?

When you run info mknod you'll see the explanation. Let me copy it here.

p for a FIFO
b for a block special file
c for a character special file
So, we have three main types of devices. C is one of them and it means character special file which... let say.. operates only in "one way". Another examples of this type in dev/random which generates random characters and cannot receive any data.

Block and fifo are not in our scope.

Last thing is MAJOR and MINOR numbers. These numbers are not random. The specific pairs are defined in Kernel. For example, mentioned random has MAJOR and MINOR number set to 1 and 8.

Ok, let's finally see our special file

file /dev/null

The response should be /dev/null: character special (1/3)

We are done!

Another way of creating /dev/nul is to run udevadm trigger --sysname-match=null . But this might not work on all systems.
