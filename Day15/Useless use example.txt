Useless use example


Well, not that useless. This is the example, how we can capture the information what STDIN is used, and act accordingly.

The script is simple (but we wil not go through details).

#!/bin/bash
if [ -t 0 ]; then
  echo stdin coming from keyboard
else
  echo stdin coming from a pipe or a file
fi
Of course, this script is already prepared by system. So, we can run it.

./script.sh

./script.sh < dummy.txt

cat dummy.txt | ./script.sh

Do you see the difference?

Answer
In the script we check the origin of input data. If it is terminal, script says that. If the input comes from file (please, notice two ways of doing it in the examples above) script notifies, that input is from file.
