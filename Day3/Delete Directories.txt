Delete directories


Let's move to the home directory. cd

pwd

ls

First, we will remove the the root directory.

rmdir root

Now, let's remove all testdir directories.

rmdir testdir{1..10}

Yes, we can use the same syntax like the one when we created these directories :)

Ok, now let's remove parentdir directory.

rmdir parentdir

Hmm. We cannot. The directory is not empty. Ok, we have a way. Do you remember the -p argument of mkdir?

rmdir -p parentdir

Nope.

We have some directory called maindir, let's look inside

ls maindir

So, we can remove parent directory only when it is empty. This will work then

rmdir -p maindir/childdir

In order to remove the whole parentdir we need to do different command, rm. This command works for files. And as everything in Linux is a file, it should work for directories too.

rm parentdir

but... it is not.

Ok, let's... do this

rmdir parentdir/*
rmdir parentdir

Hmm... If you feel it is not like the smart Linux should operate...

You're right.

we have anotherparentdir with the same structure. Let's make it right. And risky.

rm -rf anotherparentdir

Wow, that was it! But.. It didn't work wit rm earlier.

Now we used some arguments

-r means go recursively through directories (and treat everything as file)
-f - force. Another words, do not ask, assume the user knows what he is doing.
And that is why this is risky command.

Try

rm -rf /

and read the notification. Nowadays Linux try to be careful with its users and this command, do you understand why?
