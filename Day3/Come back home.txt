Time to go home!


Wherever we are in the Linux system, we have several ways to back home. Some says, all roads lead to Rome, in Linux it is almost true :)

So, first, if you remember your home directory, use it

cd /var/log
pwd
cd /root
pwd

but this is not funny way of doing it.

There is a built-in variable called $HOME. This variable contains the path to the current user home directory.

cd /var/log
pwd
cd $HOME
pwd

By the way, we can display the value of this variable, using echo $HOME
But $HOME is long. We can use something shorter - ~

cd /var/log
pwd
cd ~
pwd

And finally, the shortest version...

cd /var/log
pwd
cd
pwd

Yes, just cd is enough to come back to home directory.
