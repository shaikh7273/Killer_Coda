Move files


Ok, we know ho to copy files. Sometimes however, we want to move the file from one place to another. For this case, we need to use mv command. The usage is quite similar to cp, but... simpler.

Move one file
Let's clear the screen.

clear

Create another directory:

mkdir movedfiles

And finally we are ready to move our first file.

ls -l sourcedir/one
mv sourcedir/one movedfiles
ls -l sourcedir/one
ls -l movedfiles

Done. Obviously, we can move and change the name:

ls -l anotherdir/one
mv anotherdir/one movedfiles/another-one
ls -l anotherdir/one
ls -l movedfiles

Move a few files
Similar like with cp we are able to move a few files to another location. It looks like this:

mv file1 file2 file3 targetlocation

Let's try:

mv sourcedir/two01 sourcedir/two02 movedfiles
ls -l movedfiles

Move directories
And finally, we can move all directories.

mv anotherdir newdir
ls -l anotherdir
ls -l newdir

And it works similarily like cp did when move is perform to existing directory:

mv newdir movedfiles
ls -l newdir
ls -l movedfiles
ls -l movedfiles/newdir
