More possibilities


In order to copy file, or better to say, copy content of the file, we can use redirections.

We have a special file - .profile. Let's use this file to copy the content.

clear
ls -l newfilewithcontent.txt

File is not exist.

cat .profile > newfilewithcontent.txt

ls -l newfilewithcontent.txt

Now we have the new file. Lets see, if the content was copied.

We can do it is simple way:

cat .profile
cat newfilewithcontent.txt

In this way we visually confirmed that files are the same. But what if the file contains 10000 lines? Will we check every single line? Well, no.

We can check if there is any difference between two files. We do it with a new command - diff. This is the way to compare two files.

diff .profile newfilewithcontent.txt

No output means that both files are the same.

There are other methods to copy files. Even to copy and transform the content during the process. But this is the basic tutorial, so we are not touhing them.
