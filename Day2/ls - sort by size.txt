5. Sort by size


Sort content by size
OK, we know how to sort files by time, let's learn how to do it by size.

As usual, we have multiple options to do so.

First, we run this command

ls -s

This shows the short list of files and allocated space. As we already know, we can combine this argument - s - with others. Let's do it.

ls -ls

But this is what you have by default, using ls -l, right? No? You are correct, the answer is no. Take a look on the beginning of each line, this is where you can find, what was added by -s.

Why we used s? I wanted you to pay attention here. When capital S is used, this means sort.

ls -lS it sorts files by size, largest are going first.

So, arguments are case-sensitive, like... everything in Linux :)

Before we use the next command, there is one argument more to be learned. This argument is --human-readable, or better - -h

Let's try.

ls -lh we have printed the size of the files not in bytes, but in more readable form, with K, M, or G, that sort of things.

h use the powers of 1024. So, 1K is a 1 powered by 1024. We have another otion

ls -l --si

which uses powers of 1000. But.. I think no one uses that :)

Ok, let's try to sort with h parameter

ls -lSh
