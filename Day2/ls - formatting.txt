6. Formatting


Different formats
Ok, we are able to sort the list. Now it is time to format it a little.

The first option will be applied to simple ls.

Let's recall, how the simple ls looks like. Now, let's use it with our new argument.

ls -1

Now, please think, why it is obvious thet we do not need to use -1 with -l argument?

--format can be usable when scripting and ls is used for input for other parts of the script.

ls --format=commas will print the files separated by commas. We can use shorter syntax and write

ls -m

Surprise! -l is also the --format option. If you wish to use it in full, use ls --format=long
ls -lQ prints the filenames in quotes

--time-style changes the way how the date is formated in long format. Let's experiment:

ls -l
ls -l --time-style=locale
ls -l --time-style=iso
ls -l --time-style=full-iso
