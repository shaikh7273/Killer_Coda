7. Other options and help


A few arguments more
To finalize some usefull arguments, please take a look on these:

ls -al --author prints the username of the creator of the file.

ls -ald prints directories only. Very useful in some circumstances.

ls -ali prints inodes (there will be a lesson about inodes).

ls -alR recursively prints all subdirectories.

ls -alr prints list in the reversed order. So,

ls -alSr is printing... what? :)

Finale
Two last commands in this scenario.

ls --version prints the version of the binary.

All commands which we used here are available in help. How to get the help?

ls --help
