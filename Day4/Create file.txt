Create file(s)


In order to create empty file in Linux, we have to use touch command. Let's do it.

touch testfile

Do we have it?

ls -l testfile

Yes, the file exists. We also can see that the file has 0 size, another words, it is empty.

Of course, like in previous scenario, we can create multiple files.

touch my{01..100}file

Let's use the wildcard character * to list all of them

ls my*file

It is not what we really can use here, but if * means any string, sometimes we need to list specific subgroup. Let's prepare ourselves first.

touch try1 try2 try01

Ok, now, we want to list try1 and try2 only. If I use

ls try*

we will receive all three files.

Instead of * we can use ?. This sign means any single character.

Let's try

ls try?

Yep, this is it.

Let's now create some structure.

mkdir testdir
touch testdir/mytest{01..1000} testdir/file{01..1000}

Do you know what we've done?
