Delete file(s)


We already know the proper command. It is rm.

We can remove single file

rm try01

We can remove more than one file

rm try1 try2

We obviously can remove multiple files

rm testdir/mytest{01..1000}

And, yes, we can remove all files, directories, the whole structure

rm -rf testdir

What -rf means? It is explained in previous lesson.
