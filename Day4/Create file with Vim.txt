Vim


Ok, vim is not part of this lesson. But I'd like to make sure, that we understand that touch is not only one way to create files.

Let's run

vim mynewfile

We opened a vim editor. We wil lhave lessone about it later, now it is enough to follow the instruction.

In order to start typing anything in editor (enter insert mode), hit

i .

Put some text, for example

this is my great line

Now, hit ESC key to enter the command mode, and type :wq

You left vim and now you can check the file

ls -l mynewfile

Yes, we have the file and it is not empty!
