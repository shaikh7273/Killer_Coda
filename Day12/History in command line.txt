History in command line


If history is enabled (we will learn how to check and do it in next chapter) we can re-use previous commands.

Let's do this:

ls -al
cat .profile
ls -alh
ps

Ok, we provided a few commands. Now, if we want to display the .profile file again, we can retype the command. But it is not neccesary.

Arrows
First, we can navigate through history with arrow up anfd arrow down. Please try to find cat .profile using arrows and then execute the command again.

history command
Ok, nice. But if you already typed 1000 commands and you want to go back to the command number 268 it will be... not very convenient. In this case we can call the history:

history

Now, you can simply copy/paste the command, but it is not very professional :) As you see, there is a number just before the actual command. Lets use this number.

Please find the cat .profile command, and use its order number with leading !. Something like: !6

This will recall the command with specific number.

We can narrow the search with history command in two ways. First simple, with grep:

history | grep cat

Or, using built in functionality, if we want to see some specific and limited number of commands:

history 3

will show 3 last commands stored in history.

Interactive search
To prepare ourselves, lets run:

cat .hushlogin
cat .bashrc

And now let's see what we have

history

We should see this:

$ history
    1  ls -al
    2  cat .profile
    3  ls -lh
    4  ps
    5  cat .profile
    6  history
    7  cat .profile
    8  history | grep cat
    9  history 3
   10  cat .hushlogin 
   11  cat .bashrc
   12  history
At least, something very close.

Now we can interactively search through it. Press CTRL and r and start typing cat.

You should see cat .bashrc (the last command where searched string is equal to part of the command).

Press CTRL r again. the highlighted command changed. Very useful.

Use ESC if you wish to leave the search, or simply enter to execute the command.
