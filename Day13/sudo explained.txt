Elevate privileges


When su log us as root, sudo elevates our privileges on behalf of root (let say it this way).

Elevate privileges for users
We are logged as root, so sudo at this moment has no sense, totally. But in order to see what happens when sudo is executed, let's see it now.

Before we start, let's observe, how our processes list looks like.

ps

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    899 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   1099 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
You should see something like the list above.

We have two processes: bash which is our "main" session and ps - the process which we just executed.

We can use sudo in two ways:

If we want to run some commands as root, we can use sudo <command>. Like in the example.

sudo ps

The output will be similar to this one:

$ sudo ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    899 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   1243 pts/0    00:00:00 sudo
   1244 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
This time we have three processes. Two - bash and ps we already understand. The third is sudo itself.

Why is that? bash is the parent session. In this context we executed ps, but with sudo. Therefore sudo created its own session, where the ps were finally run.

Second method is to interactively use sudo mode and use elevated privileges in the full session (not command by command).

sudo -i
ps

-i argument means that we want to use sudo with login option, another words, to switch the session to privileged one.

The output should be like below:

$ sudo -i
$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    899 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   1299 pts/0    00:00:00 sudo
   1300 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   1308 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
Now we have four sessions. What happened here? The "main" session has PID 899. This session executed session with PID 1299 (when we typed sudo -i). in order to login to session, Linux started another session of bash (PID 1300) in which we executed our ps (PID 1308). Simple :)

Let's come back to the main session. exit

Ok, our understanding of options and usecases is better now, let's configure sudo for our two users in next chapter.
