Start with non default settings


Many of options we used before can be executed directly from the command line. Here are the examples:

top -o %MEM - run top with processes sorted by memory.

q for exit

top -c will show the full paths.

q for exit, again.

And the last example:

top -u root will show the processes owned by root user.
