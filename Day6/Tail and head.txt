Print part of the file


Despite the possibility of printing the whole file and navigate through it, we can print part of the file. We have two possibilities.

head
It we want to print first lines of the file, we can use head. By default head shows 10 lines.

head testfile

If we wish to see different number of lines, we can use -n argument and pass the number for lines.

Let's try with 2 lines

head -n2 testfile

And now for 22 lines:

head -n22 testfile

tail
tail does exactly the same thing as heead does, but from the end of the file.

tail testfile prints 10 last lines.

tail -n2 testfile will print 2 last lines, and

tail -n22 testfile will show 22 lines.

similar like with less and more, both head and tail can be used with pipes.

Let's see on the examples. Please try to understand what you will see before you execute the commands!

cat testfile | tail -n1

cat testfile | head

cat testfile | head -n4 | tail -n2
