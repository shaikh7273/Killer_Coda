Theory, continuation


Right. We've done a lot. Something still to do.

Let's list something again.

ls -l /var/log

Please, try to answer, how the system knows who is this owner? Or the group?

The answer is here:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root adm 48194 May 2 10:20 dmesg

Let's look on the picture.

We can see root root (or root adm from the log above). The firs string describes the owner, second the group. Simple like that :)

That's concludes the theory part :) After the short quiz we will finally do some hands-on!
