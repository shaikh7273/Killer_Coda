Change owner and group of the file


Let's switch back to root.

exit

And now we can navigate to student1 directory.

cd /home/student1

ls -ld student1

We see that student1 owns the file, and his group is attached. In order to change the group, we can use chgrp command. Syntax is simple.

chgrp <group> <objects>

Let's make the student2 group the 'selected one' for student1 directory.

chgrp student2 student1

ls -ld student1

Yes, the group was changed.

ls -l student1

But not the files inside the directory. Let's modify our command now.

chgrp -R student2 student1 && ls -l student1

Now it works. We simply added -R as argument, what means recursive .

Now it is time to change owner. We use chown command for it. But what is interesting, chown can also change the group. Here is the syntax:

chown <owner>:<group> <objects>

Let's try with some additional files.

touch test{01..03} && ls -l test*

chown student2 test01

chown :student2 test02

chown student1:student3 test03

Observe the results

ls -l test*

Of course, we can use recursive mode too.

chown -R student2:student3 student1

ls -ld student1

ls -al student1

Did you noticed who is the owner of ..? Do you know why?

Answer
Do you remember, what '..' means? It is the parent directory, right? Please check, who owns the parent directory?
